## Forking the GitHub Repository

### **Planning Stage**
The planning was as follows
  1. Select a project.
  2. Create user stories and dev tasks using Github Kanban board.
  3. Assign user stories to EPICS
  4. Create labels using MoSCoW method.
  6. Develop a wireframes of the potential app.
  7. Select colours for the app.
  8. Select fonts for the app.

[Github Kanban board can be found following this link]https://github.com/users/Karlsberg62/projects/4/views/1
While some variations can be visible in end product, we believe planning helped us to successfully work on this project and we tried to stay with choices made during the planning stage.
