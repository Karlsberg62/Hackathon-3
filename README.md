# College Connect (The Wombles)
College Connect is the all-in-one solution for students to engage, connect and thrive within the campus community. The site will be targeted at students eager to attend community events and event planners aiming to promote their initiatives. 
College Connect empowers students to make the most out of their college experience while providing event planners with the visibility they need to make their events a success.


### **Planning Stage**
The planning was as follows
  1. Select a project.
  2. Create user stories and dev tasks using Github Kanban board.
  3. Assign user stories to EPICS
  4. Create labels using MoSCoW method.
  6. Develop a wireframes of the potential app.
  7. Select colours for the app.
  8. Select fonts for the app.

[Github Kanban board can be found following this link]https://github.com/users/Karlsberg62/projects/4/views/1
While some variations can be visible in end product, we believe planning helped us to successfully work on this project and we tried to stay with choices made during the planning stage.
